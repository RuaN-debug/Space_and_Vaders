# Space_and_Vaders
Space Invaders is a 1978 arcade game created by Tomohiro Nishikado and is considered one of the most influencial games of all time. This is a parody of the game, really simple, but made with love :).

# Creation of the code
The game was all made in Python by following a tutorial of a channel on youtube named freeCodeCamp.org (https://www.youtube.com/Freecodecamp).
